# This program calculates the perimeter of a triangle
# perimeter of a triangle formula p = a + b + c




a = 5 # side 1 is 5 would be a 
b = 6  # the base is 6 would be b
c = 10 # side 2 is 10 would be c

perimeter = a + b + c # the variable of the formula 
print('The perimeter of your triangle is', perimeter)

# Is side 1 greater than side 2?
print('Is side 1 greater than side 2?', a > c)

# Is the base equal to side 1?
print('Is the base equal to side 1?', b == a)
