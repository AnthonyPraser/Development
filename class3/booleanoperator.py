# Boolean Operators

# # Is 7 less than 5? <
# print(2 < 5)

# # Is 4 less than or equal to 4? <=
# print(4 <= 4)

# # Is 6 greater than 2? >
# print(6 > 2)

# # Is 5 greater than or equal to 6? >=
# print(5 >= 6)

# Is 5 equal to 5? ==
# print(5 == 5)
# print(5 == 7)

# and
# print(5 == 5 and 4 == 4) # these are true because both are true
# print(5 == 5 and 4 == 3) # one true and one false equals false
# print( 4 ==2 and 1 == 8) # false because both are false 

# or
# print(5 == 5 or 5 == 3)

#not
# x = 5
# y = 7
# # Is x less than y?
# print(x < y)
# print(not x < y)

# is
# print(4 is 4) # these are the same 
# print(4 is 'four') # these are not the same 

# this will be true
# x = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherries']
